# StickeyNotes

This webpage is made for client side only , you can connect it with database and host on server.
I have used HTML , CSS , Bs5 and js to make it.

>> Working 
Logic is very simple , I have used localStorage to store notes , each note is an object having title and
description and each note is store in an array called Notes array.

>> Features 
StickeyNotes has Feature like you can add note , delete note , also you can search note by title or text 
present in the description.

StickeyNotes has  a dark-mode toggle button through which you can toggle between day and night mode.
